# Basic Public API

## Overview
This simple public API returns some basic information in JSON format (my email, this GitHub repo URL, and the current time in ISO 8601 format). It's an exercise from Stage 0 of the HNG Internship for back-end developers. You can [visit HNG to hire the best Python developers](https://hng.tech/hire/python-developers) in the world.

## Project Requirements
- Programming Language/Framework: Use any of the following: See Sharp (C#), PHP, Python, Go, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript.
- Deployment: The API must be deployed to a publicly accessible endpoint.
- CORS Handling: Ensure the API handles Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) appropriately.
- Response Format: All responses must be in JSON format.
- Endpoint `GET <your-url>`.
- The required JSON Response Format (200 OK).
- The API must accept GET requests and return the required JSON response.
- The `current_datetime` field must be dynamically generated in ISO 8601 format (UTC).
- It provides appropriate HTTP status code.

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Framework: Flask
- CORS Handling: using Flask-CORS
- Caching: using Flask Caching for improved performance
- Deployment: Railway
